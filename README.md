# Group 5

# Instructions

###Note: We already changed the schema on everything to "group5" from "political_tweets"

## Sql scripts to execute (we changed almost everything)
1 - ProjectDDL.sql

2 - ProjectInsert.sql

3 - Procedures.sql

4 - CreateDBUsers.sql

5 - CreateApplicationUsers.sql

6 - UpdateAbbreviations.sql


## Copy JSP pages into project
We used the same setup as dictated in the class setup, without any external packages. It should work by just inserting the JSP pages into the WebContent folder.


## Run Entry.JSP on a Tomcat Server

## Query Execution
Each query's structure is described on the web page. Grader need to log in for each query. All lists are inputed with a space between each string or int. All states need to be in the format of => Florida (not FL or florida or FLORIDA).
